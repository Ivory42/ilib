# ilib

My own custom library I use for all of my current TF2 plugins. 

My plugins will not compile without these dependencies, just include ilib and it will import the rest.

This differs from other similar libraries in that I prefer to use structs for mostly everything instead of methodmaps. Methodmaps have some good uses when it comes to handles, but I prefer structs for when it comes to tracking entities.
